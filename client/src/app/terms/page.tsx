            3. Employer Verification and Job Listing Standards
          </h2>
          <p>
            To prevent fraud and misleading representations, all newly registered employer organizations enter a mandatory Pending Verification status. Employers may create listing drafts, but public broadcasting of job requisitions requires authorization from Platform Administrators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Job postings must represent bona fide employment opportunities. Postings requiring upfront financial payments from applicants, multi-level marketing schemes, or misleading compensation structures are strictly prohibited and result in immediate termination of the employer account.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Candidate profiles, resumes, and communications submitted through JobPortal are shared exclusively with the employers to whom the candidate expressly applies. Employers agree to treat candidate data in accordance with applicable privacy legislation and not to resell or distribute candidate information outside their direct hiring processes.

          <p>
            Users may not attempt to circumvent authentication layers, exploit API vulnerabilities, initiate automated scraping or crawling without written authorization, or transmit malicious code through the platform. Any security concerns should be reported immediately to platform administrators.

            JobPortal serves as an intermediary platform. We do not guarantee employment offers for candidates, nor do we guarantee candidate suitability for employers. All hiring decisions, interviews, and employment agreements remain exclusively between the candidate and the prospective employer.
